# Landolt-C_Generator
 A simple Python script using PsychoPy & Pillow to create Landolt C stimuli, and then remove the white background

 The purpose of these scripts is to generate individual images that could be loaded into Unity. In its current form,
 the code generates 100 PNG files, for 100 different pixel sized Landolt C Gaps (as well as a closed C, a circle)
 First, run Landolt C Generator
 then run C white to transparent

 Then, you have your stimuli!
